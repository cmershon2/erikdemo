This repo is based on a course taught by Erik Gross from Develop Intelligence. This course helped explain DevOps and CI/CD as well as drive their adoption.

I took this course to learn more about both these topics to further my skill set to work towards becoming a developer.

## About
DevOps is a culture used during app development. The DevOps methodology relates a lot with traditional Agile development.

Some significant impacts of DevOps:
- Continuous improvement
- The system is also contantly improving

One major factor to DevOps is utilizing CI/CD (Continous Integration, Continous Deployment, and Continous Development). In the most general sense, CI/CD is automating the steps of app development. By automating these steps, it helps reduce the potential of human error.

In this demonstation project, we created a simple Node based application using Express. To integrate CI/CD, we utilized Github Actions. This actions allow for code to be compiled and deployed in an automated fashion.
